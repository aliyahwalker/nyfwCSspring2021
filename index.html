      <p>Christian Siriano’s New York Fashion Week show debuting his newest collection has become more accessible this year to the public than ever before.</p>

      <p>Access to New York Fashion Week has been coveted among fashion admirers. The event is typically only accessible to those already in the fashion industry or by invitation only. Tickets are sold for some presentations in sparing quantities;
        however they are hard to obtain. This year <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-new-york-fashion-week-take-place-september-limited-or-no-spectatorsrestrictions">due to the restrictions placed on New York Fashion
          Week by Governor Andrew Cuomo,</a> the event became more accessible to the public than it has been in the past.</p>

      <p>Collections like Siriano’s, are shown each season at New York Fashion Week, however the public has never been able to have direct access to the show as it’s happening. If videos are revealed and photos taken, it isn’t until after the show
        that the rest of the population can get a glimpse at the display.</p>

      <p>Julie Stubblefield, 53, has followed Siriano’s work since he was on <a href="https://www.thelist.com/298097/whatever-happened-to-christian-siriano-from-project-runway/">Project Runway.</a> She has always loved his work and the inclusivity
        among the models that Siriano uses. Stubblefield loved the show and tweeted afterwards, that the “show
        was amazing!!”</p>

      <p>In partnership with Lowes Hardware Stores, Siriano was able to debut his newest collection to the public through a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1296004207409917953?s=20">livestream</a> from Connecticut. With 80 guests watching from
        his home in Westport, CT, and at its peak, 41.2 thousand guests watching live. In comparison there are typically around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/arts/international/the-figures-behind-the-catwalk.html">110,000 attendees
        </a>over the course of New York Fashion Week.</p>

      <p>Danielle Hogan, 37, also thought the show was “overall amazing” and was happy with the accessibility of the event. “I'm so thrilled that designers are opening up their showrooms and their shows like this.”</p>

      <p>Siriano, who was one of the first designers to pivot to making masks in the beginning of the pandemic, paired a matching mask with each of his model’s outfits. Everyone at the event was also wearing a mask, including Siriano himself.</p>

      <p>Siriano choose to make a statement with his collection by featuring a black dress emblazoned by the word “VOTE”, with a matching hat and mask. This dress was a favorite among both Stubblefield and Danielle due to its relevance. “I think it
        makes a statement while not being one way or another,” Stubblefield stated. “There is a lot going on in our country and we need change and the way to achieve that is to VOTE!” Similarly, Hogan stated, “a dress like that speaks volumes and
        Christian has always been one to make a statement in impactful ways.”</p>
